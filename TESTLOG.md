|3|Failure|[Run Link](https://github.com/asyncapi-actions-test/cli/actions/runs/20456178197/job/58778662086) | Error occurred while publishing trusted-publishing-test_asyncapi-cli: ENEEDAUTH This command requires you to be logged in to https://registry.npmjs.org. Ignoring test-nodejs job, rest of the workflow is same as generator which worked fine as can be seen in [diff.patch](./diff.patch) |
